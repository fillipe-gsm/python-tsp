Python TSP Solver
=================

``python-tsp`` is a library written in pure Python for solving typical Traveling
Salesperson Problems (TSP). It can work with symmetric and asymmetric versions.


Installation
============
.. code:: bash

  pip install python-tsp


Quickstart
==========

Regular TSP problem
-------------------

Suppose we wish to find a Hamiltonian path with least cost for the following
problem:

.. image:: figures/python_tsp_example.png

We can find an optimal path using a Dynamic Programming method with:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   from python_tsp.exact import solve_tsp_dynamic_programming

   distance_matrix = np.array([
       [0,  5, 4, 10],
       [5,  0, 8,  5],
       [4,  8, 0,  3],
       [10, 5, 3,  0]
   ])
   permutation, distance = solve_tsp_dynamic_programming(distance_matrix)

The solution will be ``[0, 1, 3, 2]``, with total distance 17. Notice it is
always a closed path, so after node 2 we go back to 0.

There are also heuristic-based approaches to solve the same problem. For
instance, to use a local search method:

.. code:: python

   from python_tsp.heuristics import solve_tsp_local_search

   permutation, distance = solve_tsp_local_search(distance_matrix)

In this case there is generally no guarantee of optimality, but in this small
instance the answer is normally a permutation with total distance 17 as well
(notice in this case there are many permutations with the same optimal
distance).

Open TSP problem
----------------

If you opt for an open TSP version (it is not required to go back to the
origin), just set all elements of the first column of the distance matrix to
zero:

.. code:: python

   distance_matrix[:, 0] = 0
   permutation, distance = solve_tsp_dynamic_programming(distance_matrix)

and we obtain ``[0, 2, 3, 1]``, with distance 12. Notice that in
this case the distance matrix is actually asymmetric, and the methods here are
applicable as well.


Computing a distance matrix
---------------------------

The previous examples assumed you already had a distance matrix. If that is not the case, the ``distances`` module has prepared some functions to compute an Euclidean distance matrix, a Great Circle Distance, street distances (via OSRM) and support for TSPLIB-type files. Check the `docs folder <docs/distances.rst>`_ for some examples.


A more intricate example
------------------------

Let us attempt to solve the ``a280.tsp`` TSPLIB file. It has 280 nodes, so an exact
approach may take too long. Hence, let us start with a Local Search (LS) solver:


.. code:: python

    from python_tsp.distances import tsplib_distance_matrix
    from python_tsp.heuristics import solve_tsp_local_search, solve_tsp_simulated_annealing

    # Get corresponding distance matrix
    tsplib_file = "tests/tsplib_data/a280.tsp"
    distance_matrix = tsplib_distance_matrix(tsplib_file)

    # Solve with Local Search using default parameters
    permutation, distance = solve_tsp_local_search(distance_matrix)
    # distance: 3064


When calling ``solve_tsp_local_search`` like this, we are starting with a
random permutation, using the 2-opt scheme as neighborhood, and running it until
a local optimum is obtained. It is the same as this:

.. code:: python

    permutation, distance = solve_tsp_local_search(
        distance_matrix,
        x0=None,
        perturbation_scheme="two_opt",
        max_processing_time=None,
        log_file=None,
    )

Each input variable is probably self-explanatory, but you can run
``help solve_tsp_local_search`` for more information.

In my specific run, I obtained a permutation with total distance 3064. The
actual best solution for this instance is 2579, so our solution has a 18.8%
gap. Remember this solver is a heuristic, and thus it has no business in
finding the actual optimum. Moreover, you can get different results trying
distinct perturbation schemes and starting points.

Since the local search solver only obtains local minima, maybe we can get more
lucky with a metaheuristic such as the Simulated Annealing (SA):

.. code:: python

    permutation2, distance2 = solve_tsp_simulated_annealing(distance_matrix)
    # distance: 2830

In my execution, I got a 2830 as distance, representing a 9.7% gap, a great
improvement over the local search. The SA input parameters are basically the
same as the LS, but you can check ``help solve_tsp_simulated_annealing`` for
more details as well.

If you are familiar with metaheuristics, you would know that the SA does not
guarantee a local minimum, despite its solution being better than the LS in
this case. Thus, maybe we can squeeze some improvement by running a local
search starting with its returned solution:

.. code:: python

    permutation3, distance3 = solve_tsp_local_search(distance_matrix, x0=permutation2)
    # distance: 2825

So, that was o.k., nothing groundbreaking, but a nice combo to try in some
situations. Nevertheless, if we change the perturbation scheme to, say, PS3:

.. code:: python

    permutation4, distance4 = solve_tsp_local_search(
        distance_matrix, x0=permutation2, perturbation_scheme="ps3"
    )
    # distance: 2746

and there we go, a distance of 2746 or a 6.5% gap of the optimum.

The PSX schemes work directly in the permutation space as shown in the figure
below. Among these, the well-known 2-opt is very close to the PS5 and it works very
well in most instances, but sometimes other schemes may yield better results because their
neighborhoods are different.

.. image:: figures/perturbation_schemes.png

In this case, PS3 and PS6 have larger neighborhood sizes, so we may get a better
chance of improvement by switching to them in the LS step. Test other schemes
and see if you can get different results.

Finally, if you don't feel like fine-tunning the solvers for each problem, a
rule of thumb that worked relatively well for me is to run the SA with a
2-opt and follow it by a LS with PS3 or PS6, like

.. code:: python

    permutation, distance = solve_tsp_simulated_annealing(distance_matrix)
    permutation2, distance2 = solve_tsp_local_search(
        distance_matrix, x0=permutation, perturbation_scheme="ps3"
    )


Methods available
=================
There are two types of solvers available:

:Exact: Methods that always return the optimal solution of a problem.
        Use these solvers in relatively small instances (wherein "small" is
        relative to your requirements).

        - ``exact.solve_tsp_brute_force``: checks all permutations and returns
          the best one;

        - ``exact.solve_tsp_dynamic_programming``: uses a Dynamic Programming
          approach. It tends to be faster than the previous one, but it may
          demand more memory.

:Heuristics: These methods have no guarantees of finding the best solution,
             but usually return a good enough candidate in a more reasonable
             time for larger problems.

             - ``heuristics.solve_tsp_local_search``: local search heuristic.
               Fast, but it can get stuck in a local minimum;

             - ``heuristics.solve_tsp_simulated_annealing``: the Simulated
               Annealing metaheuristic. It may be slower, but it has better
               chances of avoiding getting trapped in local minima.


For developers
==============
The project uses `Python Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ to manage
dependencies. Check the website for installation instructions, or simply
install it with

.. code:: bash

   pip install poetry

After that, clone the repo and install dependencies with ``poetry install``.

Here are the detailed steps that should be followed before making a pull
request:

.. code:: bash

  # Autopep8 and flake8 to be conformant with PEP8
  poetry run autopep8 --recursive --aggressive --in-place .
  poetry run flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
  poetry run flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=79 --statistics

  # Mypy for proper type hints
  poetry run mypy --ignore-missing-imports .

You can also run all of these steps at once with the check-up bash script:

.. code:: bash

   ./.scripts/checkup_scripts.sh
   bash ./.scripts/checkup_scripts.sh  # if the previous one fails

Finally (and of course), make sure all tests pass and you get at least 95% of
coverage:

.. code:: bash

  poetry run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=95 tests/
