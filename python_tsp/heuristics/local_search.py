    """Solve a TSP problem with a local search heuristic

    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_matrix
        Distance matrix of shape (n x n) with the (i, j) entry indicating the
        distance from node i to j

    x0
        Initial permutation. If not provided, it starts with a random path

    perturbation_scheme {"ps1", "ps2", "ps3", "ps4", "ps5", "ps6", ["two_opt"]}
        Mechanism used to generate new solutions. Defaults to "two_opt"

    max_processing_time {None}
        Maximum processing time in seconds. If not provided, the method stops
        only when a local minimum is obtained

    log_file
        If not `None`, creates a log file with details about the whole
        execution

    verbose
        If true, prints algorithm status every iteration

    Returns
    -------
    A permutation of nodes from 0 to n - 1 that produces the least total
    distance obtained (not necessarily optimal).

    The total distance the returned permutation produces.

    Notes
    -----
    Here are the steps of the algorithm:
        1. Let `x`, `fx` be a initial solution permutation and its objective
        value;
        2. Perform a neighborhood search in `x`:
            2.1 For each `x'` neighbor of `x`, if `fx'` < `fx`, set `x` <- `x'`
            and stop;
        3. Repeat step 2 until all neighbors of `x` are tried and there is no
        improvement. Return `x`, `fx` as solution.
